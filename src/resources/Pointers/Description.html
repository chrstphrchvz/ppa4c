			POINTERS&nbsp;</h3>
		<div>
			The pointer data type is used to hold a memory address. Using a pointer, an object in memory, such as another variable, can be accessed without needing access to the variable itself; a function, e.g. <code>scanf()</code>, is given a pointer to data to use or update instead of only being given a copy of it. Arrays and strings also make use of pointers that correspond to their starting addresses in memory.&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			Declaring a pointer is done with the data type of the memory object followed by <code>*</code>; if a pointer isn't used right away when declared, it should be assigned <code>NULL</code> (which is usually defined as 0), e.g.</div>
		<div>
			<code>int *num_ptr = NULL;&nbsp;</code></div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			Otherwise, an address of an object can be assigned to a pointer by using the address-of operator <code>&amp;</code>:</div>
		<div>
			<code>num_ptr = &amp;num1;&nbsp;</code></div>
		<div>

		<div>
			Pointers to scalar objects can be used in place of variables using the dereference operator <code>*</code>:</div>
		<div>
			<code>int num2 = *num_ptr;&nbsp;</code></div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			(Recall how <code>scanf()</code> requires the <code>&amp;</code> operator before the names of local variables used to record input: this is so that <code>scanf()</code> knows where the local variable is in memory in order to modify it; what is actually passed to <code>scanf()</code> is a pointer, rather than the value of a variable.)</div>
