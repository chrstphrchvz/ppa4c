		<h1>While Loops&nbsp;</h1></center>
		<left><h2>Description</h2>
<p>While loops While loops will execute a statement while a condition is true. </p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>while(condition) {  statement } </p> 

<h2>Code Example:</h2>
 
<p>So for example you would like to print hello 25 times. 
<p>To do this you will want to do the following;</p>

<p>-> While x &lt; 25 
<br>--> print hello 
<br>--> add 1 to x </p>

<p>   Here is the code for that while loop</p>

<p><font color ='blue'> x=0; 
<br><font color ='blue'>while(x &lt; 25)
<br><font color ='blue'> {  
<br><font color ='blue'> &nbsp printf(&quot;hello&quot;);  
<br><font color ='blue'> &nbsp x=x+1; 
<br><font color ='blue'> } </p></font> 

<p>This is what will happen  </p>

<p>- The diagram above shows that x will be compared to 25. 
<br>- In the first iteration x will be equal to 0.  
<br>- Since the content of x is less than 25 hello will be printed and x will be increased by one.  
<br>- In the second iteration x will be equal to 1. This time it is also less than 25. </p>

<p>This pattern continues until x equal to or above 25. At this point the loop will end.  </p>
