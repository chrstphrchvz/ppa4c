		<h1>For Loops&nbsp;</h1></center>
		<left><h2>Description</h2>
<p>For loops will execute a statement for specific number of iterations 

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>for(variable=number;condition;variable modification)
<br>{
<br> &nbsp; statement;
<br>}</p>

<h2>Code Example:</h2>

<p>So for example you want to multiply a number y by 5, 10 times. 
<br>You would want to do the following </p>

<p>-> while x<10 
<br>--> multiply y by 5
<br>--> add 1 to x</p>


<p>   Here is the code for that for loop</p>

<p><font color ='blue'> y=1;
<br><font color ='blue'>for(x=0;x&lt;10;x=x+1)
<br><font color ='blue'>{
<br><font color ='blue'> &nbsp; y=y*5;
<br><font color ='blue'>}</font></p>

<p>This is what will happen  </p>

<p>- The diagram above shows that x will be compared to 10. 
<br>- The contents of variable x will be set to 0. 
<br>- Since 0 is less than 10 y will be multiplied by 5. This will set y = 5. 
<br>- The x will than be increased by 1 as specified in the FOR statement. 
<br>- In the next iteration x will be equal to 1. 
<br>- Since x will be less than 10, y will again be multiplied by 5.
<br>- At this point y will be equal to 25.</p> 

<p>This pattern will continue until x is equal to or less than 10.</p>
