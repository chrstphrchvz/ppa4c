<h1>For Selection Sort&nbsp;</h1></center>

<left><h2>Description</h2>

<p>Selection sort will check each item in a list select the and move each item individually.</p>

<p>In sorting an array of numbers from smallest to largest using selection sort.<br> The smallest number would be selected and moved to the front of the array.</p>

<p>Let us break down the selection sort process using the following array as an example</p>

<p>0 &nbsp 1 &nbsp 2 &nbsp 3 &nbsp 4 &nbsp 5 &nbsp 6 &nbsp 7 &nbsp 8 &nbsp 9
<br>3 &nbsp 1 &nbsp 6 &nbsp 18 &nbsp 20 &nbsp 5 &nbsp 11 &nbsp 7 &nbsp 14 &nbsp 2</p>

<p>To sort from smallest to biggest you will look at each item in the array and move the smallest to the front.</p>

<p>So is the item array[0] the smallest item? 
<br>No item array[1]=1 is smaller. Is there anything smaller?
<br>No so we move item array[1]=1 to the front of the array by switching the two items.</p>

<p>array[0] now contains 1 and array[1] now contains 3.<p>

<p>Next you will compare the next item on the array to all the other array items. 
<br>This means next you will compare array[1] to array[1-9]
<br>This will continue until you have compared and moved all the appropriate items.</p>

<p>The progression will be as follows:</p>
