			PPA4C is a program to practice using pseudocode (informal language describing a program in English) to write C programs. The exercises included with PPA4C use an easy multiple-choice format and include reference background material for each topic to help study or review various topics in C programming.</p>
		
		<p>
			This short exercise will show you how to use the program.</p>
		<p>
			On the left is the <strong>Topics</strong> list: use this to navigate to <strong>exercises</strong> and different <strong>categories</strong>. The arrows &lt; and &gt; on the window divider can be used to hide and show the topics list (you can also drag the divider around).</p>
		<p>
			Once an exercise is chosen, it appears to the right of the divider.</p>
		<p>
			The<strong> description</strong> tab (where you are now) will normally show the description for an exercise&#39;s topic, giving background information needed to complete the exercise.</p>
		<p>
			After reading the description, go to the <strong>Practice</strong> tab at the top; you can go between the description and practice tabs as needed. Go over to the Practice tab to learn more about it.</p>
