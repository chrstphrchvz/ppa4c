Welcome to the practice tab!

This is the pseudocode area,
where notes for a program will appear.

Note that most lines of the pseudocode
will correspond to lines of the actual program, e.g.: 
	
    Pseudocode                        C code

    initialize n to 15        ->      int n = 15;
    loop until n is 0:        ->      while(n != 0){ 
        print n               ->          printf("%d", n);
        subtract 3 from n     ->          n -= 3;}


On the right-hand side of the screen is the C program form,
a.k.a. "Your work".
Most of the C program is done for you;
use the drop-down boxes to finish the program.

For this intro, set each choice
to obtain the statements below: 
    int a = 9;
    double b = 4.0;
    char c = 'q';

Pick your answers, and then click "Check work"
in the lower-right corner.
The Results dialog will then appear with feedback.
