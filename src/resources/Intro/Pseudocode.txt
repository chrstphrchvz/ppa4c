Welcome to the practice tab!

This is the pseudocode area,
where notes for a program will appear.

Note that most lines of the pseudocode
will correspond to lines of the actual program. 

To the right is the C program form, a.k.a. "Your work".
Most of the C program is done for you;
use the drop-down boxes to finish the program.

For this intro, set each choice
to obtain the statements below: 
	int a = 9;
	double b = 4.0;
	char c = 'q';

Pick your answers, and then click "Check work"
in the lower-right corner.
The Results dialog will then appear with feedback.
