
Start
	Create array with 1000 elemnts
	create integers x,y, and n
	make boolean
	ask for user to input amount of elements in array
	ask user to input # of integers

	for x less than n
	scan elements into array[x]

	do while
	boolean equals false
	
	count y less than n -1
	
	if array[y] greater than array[y + 1]
	create integer swap which is equal to array[y+1]
	array[y+1] equal to array[y]
	array[y] equal to swap
	boolean equal to true
	while(boolean)
	print bubble list
	count y less than equal to n - 1 
	print array[y] elements
