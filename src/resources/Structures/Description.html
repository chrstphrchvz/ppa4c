<h1>Structures</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A structure is complex data type declaration that defines a <i>grouped</i> list of variables that are placed in a block of memory. Structures may contain variables of different data types. ( i.e. int, char, float, etc )</p>

<h2>Structure Definition</h2>

<p>The following is an example a struct definition. This structure, car, has two members. Members consist of variables which in turn consist of data types. </p>

<p>struct car {</p>

<p>char *color; // Color of the car</p>

<p>int doorNum; // Number of doors on the car</p>

<p>}; // Please note that a struct ends with a semi-colon</p>



<h2>Initializing a Structure</h2>

<p>A structure is initialized similar to a datatype (i.e. int, char, float, etc )</p>

<p>To declare a struct, a programmer must type in this fashion:</p>



<p>struct car aCar; // “aCar” is the name of the specific instance of the car struct</p>



<h2>Accessing Structure Members</h2>

<p>A struct’s variables are accessed through a structure member operator ( . ) or a structure pointer operator ( -&gt; ). To obtain a struct’s size, the sizeof() function should be used. </p>

<p>Example:</p>



<p>D printf( “%s”, aCar.color ); //accessing color data through a declared struct</p>

<p>D printf(“%s”, aCarPtr-&gt;color ); //accessing color data through a pointer</p>



<h1>Example</h1>

<p>struct car {</p>

<p>char *color;</p>

<p>int doorNum;</p>

<p>};</p>

<p>int main( void )</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>struct car aCar;</p>

<p>struct car *carPtr;</p>

<p>aCar.color = “Red”; // Access through member operator</p>

<p>aCar.doorNum = 4;</p>

<p>carPtr = &amp;aCar;</p>

<p>printf( “%s\n%d\n”, carPtr-&gt;color, carPtr-&gt;doorNum ); //Access through arrow operator</p>

<p>}</p>
