Write a program that subtracts 2 from x if it is a positive number and inverts the sign if it is negative

Start
Declare an integer variables x1 and x2
Set x1 to 12
set x2 to -3
     If x1 is greater than or equal to 0
          set x1 equal to x1 minus 2
     
     else
	  invert x1 
     output x1	

     If x2 is greater than or equal to 0
          set x2 equal to x1 minus 2

     else
	  invert x2
     output x2

end
