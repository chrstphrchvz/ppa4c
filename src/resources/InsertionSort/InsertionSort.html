			Insertion Sort does exactly as it sounds; it inserts each element of the array into its proper position. Insertion sort goes through the array and iterates down the array for each element to fix into place just like this image bellow.</p>

			Coding the insertion is fairly strait forward, please refer too Bubble sort and its example, an algorithm that is typically laid out for insertions is this:</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			for (k = i; k &gt; 1 and a[k] &lt; a[k-1]; k--)</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; swap a[k,k-1]</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			Though in the problem it will be slightly coded differently keep in mind that it is similar to bubble sort besides this algorithm.</p>
