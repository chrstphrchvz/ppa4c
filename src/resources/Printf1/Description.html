		<h2>
			<code>printf()</code>
			PART 1
		</h2>
	</center>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
		The
		<code>printf()</code>
		function, short for print formatted, is one of the many functions used
		to output a variety of data to stdout for the user to read.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>printf()</code>
		takes a string as its first argument (for now, a string is a sequence
		of characters between double quotes); this string can just contain a
		constant/hard-coded message, like
		<code>&quot;Hello World!&quot;</code>
		, but it can also be used to print data that might be generated by the
		program, such as a variable (cf. part 2).
	</p>

	<h2>Syntax</h2>
	<p>
		For a program to use
		<code>printf()</code>
		, it needs the standard I/O library,
		<code>stdio.h</code>
		; this is done by placing the line
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>
	</p>
	<p>at the beginning of the .c file for a program.</p>
	<p>
		<code>printf()</code>
		is called in its own statement--no declarations, operations, etc. are
		needed:
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;printf();</code>
	</p>
	<p>is how it would appear on its own line.</p>
	<h2>Code Example</h2>
	<p>To print a single string with <code>printf()</code>, place the string inside
		the parentheses:</p>
	<p>
		<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;printf(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);</code>
	</p>
