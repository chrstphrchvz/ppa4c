			printf() part 1</p>
		<p>
			I/O Introduction</p>
		<p>
			There are a variety of functions for sending data to the user (using the standard output, stdout) and getting data from the user (using the standard input, stdin). Two common and powerful functions are printf() and scanf().</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			The printf() function, short for print formatted, is used to output a variety of data to stdout for the user to read.</p>
		<p>
			printf() takes a string as its first argument (for now, a string is a sequence of characters between double quotes); this string can just contain a constant/hard-coded message, like &quot;Hello World!&quot;, but it can also be used to print data that might be generated by the program, such as a variable (cf. part 2).</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			Usage</p>
		<p>
			For a program to use printf(), it needs the standard I/O library, stdio.h; this is done by placing the line</p>
		<p>
			#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>
		<p>
			at the beginning of the .c file for a program.</p>
		<p>
			printf() is called in its own statement--no declarations, operations, etc. are needed:</p>
		<p>
			printf();</p>
		<p>
			is how it would appear on its own line.</p>
		<p>
			To print a single string with printf(), place the string inside the parentheses:</p>
		<p>
			printf(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);</p>
